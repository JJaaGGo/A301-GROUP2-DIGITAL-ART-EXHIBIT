        At TAGAI, meaning "to give in" in Bisaya, we believe that true design
        doesn't shout - it whispers. We create and curate minimalist works that give space
        for meaning, emotion, and purpose to breathe. Every piece we showcase is a gift of
        simplicity - crafted with intention, clarity, and calm.

        We are a creative gallery dedicated to minimalist design across various
        mediums - digital art, graphic design, typography, photography, and product
        design.
        <br><br>
        Each collection in TAGAI embodies balance, harmony, and quiet confidence. Whether
        it's a sleek visual composition, a clean layout, or a carefully crafted object, our
        goal remains the same: to give meaning through minimalism.

        "Whenever I see anything, it could be something grand like a gala, something mundane like swaying blades of grass, I feel the gears in my head turning, 
        wondering if there's something more I could do with them. And before I know it, I'm already hard at work, and I just can't seem to stop until I create 
        something I deem picture perfect."

        "Anything can be an inspiration, and everything I do with it--<strong>(inspiration)</strong>--is an experiment. What works and what doesn't, 
        to my taste or to my exempt, I exploit my ideas to the point of its succession."

        "Doing creative work enables me to do things that interest me. It focuses my attention to the essence of the creative process, 
        curious about how different forms of art are created. From learning, failing, then incorporating new knowledge, gaining wisdom. 
        It's a journey that doesn't end, an endlessly moving goalpost."
